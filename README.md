ChattyServer - Full-Stack Real-Time Chat Application
A full-stack, real-time messaging application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and powered by Socket.IO for instant, bi-directional communication. This platform allows users to sign up, log in, find other users, and engage in private, one-on-one conversations with live online presence indicators and image sharing capabilities.

Features
This project is a complete full-stack application with a feature-rich client and a robust backend.

Backend Features
Real-Time Communication: Implemented with Socket.IO for instant message delivery and live online user status tracking.

Secure RESTful API: Built with Node.js and Express.js, featuring protected endpoints for all sensitive operations.

JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication and session management using JSON Web Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

Database Management: Utilizes MongoDB with Mongoose for efficient data modeling and retrieval of users, messages, and conversations.

Cloud Media Storage: Integrates with Cloudinary for scalable cloud-based storage of user profile pictures and shared images.

Environment-Based Configuration: Uses .env files for secure management of sensitive credentials and application settings.

Frontend Features
Component-Based UI: Developed with React.js for a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase.

Centralized State Management: Employs Zustand for efficient and predictable global state management of user authentication, messages, and online users.

Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-first, and fully responsive user interface that works on any device.

Client-Side Routing: Uses React Router to handle navigation and create a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience.

Real-Time Updates: The UI listens for WebSocket events to update messages and user presence indicators instantly without needing to refresh the page.

User Experience (UX) Enhancements: Includes features like skeleton loading screens, toast notifications for feedback, and image previews before uploading.

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.x or higher)

npm (v9.x or higher)

MongoDB URI (from a local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

Cloudinary account credentials (API Key, Secret, Cloud Name)

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/mohitkumar4/chattyServer.git
cd chattyServer/backend
Install NPM packages:

Bash

npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your own credentials.

Code snippet

PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
Run the backend server:

Bash

npm run dev
The server will start on http://localhost:5001.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root:

Bash

cd ../frontend
Install NPM packages:

Bash

npm install
Run the frontend development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The React application will open in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

You should now have the full application running locally on your machine.
